    <h1>A LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS</h1>
    <p><i>Written from the perspective of Eris Morn</i></p>
    <p>The days have become indecipherable. This harsh plane of existence bears only Darkness and cold—two things I’ve
        become reacquainted with since my banishment to this hellscape. No matter where I run, the glowing orb follows.
        It stalks me.</p>
    <p>I’ve taken to quietly humming a tune to stave off the madness. I don’t enjoy it, but it helps. It’s worked
        before, when I was trapped beneath the Moon’s surface. Taken and Hive run rampant here. Around every corner. I’m
        in no shape to defend myself. My mind fights to stay alert. I just need to rest. Just a little…</p>
    <p>A bright light awakens me. That glowing orb? Its radiance calls out to me.</p>
    <p>No. Stop it. I’m losing my grip again. Hum the song.</p>
    <p><b>Toland the Shattered (presumably):</b> “Eris!”</p>
    <p>You’re making it up. Or worse. It’s the Witch again.</p>
    <p><b>T:</b> “Eris!”</p>
    <p>The orb approaches. Could it be?</p>
    <p>I stand to meet the light. And I collapse into darkness.</p>
    <p>I am awake, I believe—though this feels like a dream.</p>
    <p><b>T:</b> “You encountered the Witch-Queen and survived.”</p>
    <p>I am not sure if this conversation with Toland is real or a figment of my imagination.</p>
    <p><b>Eris Morn:</b> “I’m no closer to discovering their machinations.”</p>
    <p><b>T:</b> “Tell me, what did she say?”</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “It was riddles… taunts. She used you, all of you, perverting your voices… I was close to something.
        Beneath the surface. Slumbering.”</p>
    <p><b>T:</b> “Intriguing.”</p>
    <p>Either way, I am in need of an exit. I must continue, no matter the pain.</p>
    <p><b>T:</b> “Where do you think you’re going? You’re in no shape to move.”</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “I have to. I need to.”</p>
    <p><b>T:</b> “Are you telling yourself this to motivate, or are you blinded by your obsession?”</p>
    <p>Now I am sure he is real.</p>
    <p><b>T:</b> “Aren’t you curious what was slumbering down there? I know I am.”</p>
    <p>He piques my interest. I’ll allow this momentary reprieve.</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “Go on.”</p>
    <p><b>T:</b> “Our time in the Hellmouth… requires further examination. I’ve often thought back to our glorious
        failure. Something has never sat right with me.”</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “I imagine dying would leave one unsettled.”</p>
    <p><b>T:</b> “True, but this lies beyond that void. Our fireteam was comprised of some of the best to ever wield the
        Light, and yet we were eviscerated with ease.”</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “They had weapons… we were not prepared.”</p>
    <p><b>T:</b> “While true, does the circumstance not bother you?”</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “It haunts me to this day. I hesitate to believe anything She would say.”</p>
    <p><b>T:</b> “But why would She say anything at all?”</p>
    <p>Why indeed.</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “…She means to guide me, Toland.”</p>
    <p><b>T:</b> “Do not play into Her hand.”</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “You lend credence to Her riddles. We must know the truth, no matter the cost.”</p>
    <p><b>T:</b> “Tread lightly, Eris. Or you may end up like me yet. Or worse!”</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “My charge is the same, as always.”</p>
    <p><b>T:</b> “I’m afraid so.”</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “There must—”</p>
    <p>A flash of light, and once again I cannot see. I hear Toland call out to me, but I am pulled from him, from
        there.</p>
    <p>It’s warm now. And bright. So bright.</p>
    <p>*CLICK*</p>
    <p>I can feel their guns on me.</p>
    <p>I’m surrounded.</p>
