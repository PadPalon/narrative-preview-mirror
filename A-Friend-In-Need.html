    <h1>A FRIEND IN NEED</h1>
    <p><i>Written from the perspective of Eris Morn</i></p>
    <p>There’s a heat behind my eyes. I’d forgotten warmth, what it felt like. All I can make out are the weapons
        pointed at my face. If this is my fate, I will end with the fury of a tempest.</p>
    <p><b>Petra:</b> “Lower your guns!”</p>
    <p>Petra?</p>
    <p><b>P:</b> “Eris Morn. Apologies for the welcome. Never know what will come out of there.”</p>
    <p>The Dreaming City. I did not think I ever would set foot here.</p>
    <p><b>Eris Morn:</b> “This place… it’s miraculous .”</p>
    <p><b>P:</b> “Don’t get used to it. We won’t be staying long.”</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “Where are we going?”</p>
    <p><b>P:</b> “To see the Queen.”</p>
    <hr>
    <p><b>E:</b> “The Witch aims to bait me. I require your guidance, my Queen .”</p>
    <p><b>Mara Sov:</b> “She is calculated, meticulous. Proceed cautiously. Her intent is obscured.”</p>
    <p>My Queen is wise.</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “Where do we begin?”</p>
    <p><b>M:</b> “Eris… there is understandable urgency in this matter…”</p>
    <p>Not you too. Please do not think lesser of me.</p>
    <p><b>M:</b> “You were on the brink of death. That is not a loss I’m willing to bear.”</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “The shadow of death cannot hinder me.”</p>
    <p>She takes a concerned pause at my words. Did I misspeak?</p>
    <p><b>M:</b> “You walk a thin line between duty and obsession. Take it from one with experience.”</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “I am driven, but only due to what is at stake.”</p>
    <p><b>M:</b> “And what is that to you?”</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “My Queen … everything. Human and Awoken alike will wash up on the shores of death if we do not act.”
    </p>
    <p><b>M:</b> “No. What is it to you?”</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “…vengeance.”</p>
    <p>I watch as she deliberates the validity of my claims. To be dismissed as mad now would be my end.</p>
    <p><b>M:</b> “A noble cause.”</p>
    <p>The same desire runs through my Queen’s veins.</p>
    <p><b>M:</b> “Savathûn’s cunning has its limits... We retrieved a log dating back to the Golden Age that may aid in
        deciphering Her riddles. It is one of many. The rest are scattered across the stars.”</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “I must seek them all out.”</p>
    <p><b>M:</b> “You will not have to do it alone.”</p>
    <p>My queen.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>The months working alongside my Queen were exhilarating and treacherous. I’ve traversed more of the known
        universe than I ever thought I would see. Through all the vile creatures vanquished and treasures discovered
        lurks a new sensation… A place in this story.</p>
    <p>We’ve collected several of the logs we seek. Each offers a new perspective on the threat we all face. The Golden
        Age understanding of the concepts of Light and Darkness were primitive, nascent. I wonder if in the millennia
        that will come to pass, our comprehension will be viewed similarly. It matters not, if we are unable to avoid
        our looming calamity.</p>
    <p>We have come so far, and now I feel our journey coming to a close.</p>
    <p>It’s here, in these ruins. I can sense it.</p>
    <p>I push the refuse off an ancient chest.</p>
    <p>Inside—what we’ve been searching for.</p>
    <p>I read. My worst fears confirmed.</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “My Queen … it’s been there all along.”</p>
    <p>To think I must return to those twisted tunnels where the screams of my fireteam will undoubtedly reverberate
        throughout my mind…</p>
    <p>My fate is eternally bound to that place.</p>
    <p>There is no escape.</p>
