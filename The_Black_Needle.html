    <h1>THE BLACK NEEDLE</h1>
    <p>My head is throbbing, but I press on. This place I have found—it promotes pain. The Hive are fond of the
        anguish they bring. They will not deter me. It’s been months since I left the Tower. What do I have to show
        for my journey? Dead ends. Whispers. Nothing.</p>
    <p>Whatever the Hive are plotting eludes me. Each location I survey holds the promise of answers, yet each has
        let me down.</p>
    <p>Let this be the one.</p>
    <p>I feel myself drawing near as the tunnels turn from rock and filth to tiles and pomp. Something… is off. I
        have yet to encounter even a single Thrall. I would count myself lucky, but I know better.</p>
    <p>Stick to the shadows. Use the columns and pillars. Caution isn’t cautious enough.</p>
    <p>I see ancient scrolls. Tablets. Something here must prove useful.</p>
    <p>No.</p>
    <p>Incomprehensible babble. Could I have been wrong all along? Are they as lost as we are?</p>
    <p>A light breeze scatters the scrolls. A breeze? Underground?</p>
    <p>“Eris…"</p>
    <p>A voice carried on the wind. Sai? It can’t be.</p>
    <p>A laugh from down the corridor. Eriana’s. “Come back to us, Eris.” Vell…</p>
    <p>They’re dead. This can’t be real. I won’t fall prey to tricks of the Hive.</p>
    <p>The gust picks up, bringing with it the dust and soot from the tunnels. It sucks the air from the room. I
        can barely stand.</p>
    <p>“Did you believe it would be so easy?” Toland this time. The voice echoes all around me.</p>
    <p>This cruelty…</p>
    <p>“No, Witch. I thought it… would prove more difficult… to find you.”</p>
    <p>A wailing scream assaults me. It’s a scream etched deeply in my mind. Poor Omar…</p>
    <p>I won’t let Her shake me.</p>
    <p>“Tell me, Archentrope, now that you have me… what will you do with me?”</p>
    <p>Eriana appears before me, a construct of rock and sand. How dare She—</p>
    <p>“Do? Child of the Hive, can’t you see? We are one. Do you hate it?”</p>
    <p>I cringe with displeasure. Child of the Hive? Am I? Is this why I am still alive? I refuse.</p>
    <p>“You are no more my family than a parasite is to a host. You will die, like your brother before you.”</p>
    <p>She cackles. My stomach turns.</p>
    <p>“If only you had gazed upon the dark majesty that slumbered beneath you…”</p>
    <p>Beneath me? Her words are twisted half-truths. Do not succumb.</p>
    <p>The dirt and debris in the air spin wildly, colliding into me. I’m trapped in a whirlwind. My chest grows
        tight. Breath short. I can’t see. It’s all around me.</p>
    <p>“To be so near, only to scratch the surface, must tear at the filament of your mind.”</p>
    <p>The storm begins to die down; I hack up the grime, regaining my sight.</p>
    <p>“Open your eyes, Eris…”</p>
    <p>The color dissipates from the world around me.</p>
    <p>As the dust settles, I realize I am not where I was. A green-black sun hangs in the sky and a glowing orb
        floats in the distance.</p>
    <p>Darkness is all around me and I am alone. Again.</p>
