    <h1>SPLINTERED</h1>
    <p><b>Ikora Rey:</b> “Your tea has gone cold.”</p>
    <p>I had forgotten Ikora handed it to me. My thoughts are preoccupied.</p>
    <p><b>Eris Morn:</b> “I… have been burned before.”</p>
    <p><b>I:</b> “Was that a joke from the dark and brooding Eris Morn? I’m shocked.”</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “The universe has many corners. There is much that is shocking still left to uncover."</p>
    <p>The moment hangs for us both.</p>
    <p><b>I:</b> “I was thinking: We should go down to the City. There’s a great ramen shop there. Perfect blend of
        spice and flavor.”</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “That would be nice.”</p>
    <p>She’s studying me now. Does she know?</p>
    <p><b>I:</b> “You’re leaving.”</p>
    <p>She always sees through me.</p>
    <p><b>I:</b> “Tell me I’m wrong.”</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “There is a greater purpose.”</p>
    <p>This does little to satisfy her. Her face carries the weight of disappointment.</p>
    <p><b>I:</b> “When will you be back?”</p>
    <p>I have no answer.</p>
    <p><b>I:</b> “So you’re abandoning us.”</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “There is still much to be done. You don’t know what I have seen.”</p>
    <p><b>I:</b> “We would have been lost without you. We need you here. You know this.”</p>
    <p>If I were to tell her where I was I going—what I need to do—she would not allow me to leave.</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “I have to do this alone. It’s—”</p>
    <p><b>Zavala:</b> “Let her go.”</p>
    <p>Zavala. Always has to weigh in.</p>
    <p><b>Z:</b> “Eris has made her decision. You can’t force her to stay.”</p>
    <p><b>I:</b> “I don’t think you know what you’re saying, Zavala. Are you forgetting we only survived because of
        her?”</p>
    <p><b>Z:</b> “And we’re all grateful, but if we can’t live with the absence of one person, we won’t survive very
        long.”</p>
    <p>This is a battle Ikora can’t win. I won’t let her fight.</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “Your whispers carry throughout the Tower. Were I not in it, as you would prefer, I wouldn’t have to
        endure them any further.”</p>
    <p>The brave commander can’t even bring himself to look at me.</p>
    <p><b>I:</b> “Is this true?”</p>
    <p>Ikora, you already know. I cannot waste more time.</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “As I told Asher, there is a storm coming...”</p>
    <p><b>I:</b> “Oryx is dead. We’ve weathered the storm.”</p>
    <p>Ikora is upset. She has yet to understand the bigger picture.</p>
    <p><b>E:</b> “Yet his sisters would see his will done. There will always be another storm.”</p>
    <p><b>I:</b> “Then let’s weather it together.”</p>
    <p>It’s my turn to hang my head.</p>
    <p><b>Z:</b> “We made do without her before. We can do it again.”</p>
    <p>I thank Zavala with a nod. We have found common ground. Ikora, however…</p>
    <p><b>I:</b> “You see everything but what you already have.”</p>
    <p>She turns to leave and I won’t stop her. She is not wrong.</p>
    <p><b>Z:</b> “Good luck.”</p>
    <p>Zavala’s words ring hollow.</p>
    <p>It pains me to part in this way, but I can’t endanger anyone else.</p>
    <p>I alone have been entrusted with this.</p>
    <p>They will come to understand, should I survive.</p>
